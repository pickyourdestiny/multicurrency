This is a very simple multi-currency NumberBox built using DevExtreme widgets in React.

A Numberbox button is used to initiate a Popover, which contains a SelectBox widget to allow a user to search for and select a currency by currency code or country/currency name.

When a currency is selected it changes the currency symbol for the Numberbox.
